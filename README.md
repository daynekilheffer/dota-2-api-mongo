#dota-2-api-mongo
Example project using dota-2-api to insert a match into a mongo db

##Setup

This project expects a few settings to be available in the environment.

Before you can run this project, export the following values:
```
export mongouser=<name>
export mongopass=<pass>
export mongohost=<host>
export mongodb=<db>
```

I personally have been experimenting with [mongohq]'s(https://www.mongohq.com/)'s [sandbox database](https://www.mongohq.com/pricing/).
